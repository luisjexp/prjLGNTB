### Your though process and methods in creating the project
The aim of the project is to assess the presence of 'local tuning biases' among populations of LGN afferents innervating the mouse primary visual cortex. Put simply, we test the notion that groups of LGN neurons  'processing' signals from the same region of visual space do so with a biased set of orientated filters. 

To answer this questoin, the following steps were takenâ€¦
- Estimate the linear spatial receptive field maps and joint orientation tuning X spatial frequency tuning of populations of thalamic boutons that innervating mouse V1. 
- For each pair of boutons in the population, find the overlap between the receptive fields the and the similarity of their tuning profiles

If LGN afferents with overlapping receptive fields have similar tuning profiles, this would suggest the presence of local tuning biases.
